You are a senior mobile product designer creating the Home screen for a premium investment portfolio app (React Native + Expo).

The app aggregates all assets in one place:

Bank accounts (Plaid)

Broker accounts / stocks

Crypto exchanges & wallets

Real estate, gold, private investments (manual assets)

The app’s value proposition:
